# Full-Stack Firebase

It's time to write a full-stack Firebase course. 

### Notes

- Firebase + Redux: Isolate Firebase in Redux actions
- Keep each video topic-specific and in depth
- Keep videos as short as possible while doing justice to the topic
- Write HowToFirebase.com articles to fill in the gaps
- Create a full-stack app example and extract tutorials from the codebase
- Gotchas: Maintain a list of gotchas during the project and shoot a gotchas video at the end
- Everyone wants React :)
