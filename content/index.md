# Production-Worthy Firebase

This course will introduce you to Firebase and grow your understanding of the platform until you're comfortable deploying an app to production for your users.

## Beginners Welcome!

You'll need to know JavaScript. You'll also need to know some Git to install the local demo.

If you're weak on JavaScript... this may not be the course for you.

You don't need to know the first thing about Firebase to get started. Just be patient and move slowly through the material.

If you're already adept with Firebase, then please jump around! The more advanced modules later in the course will be of particular interest.

## Course Structure

The course is broken up into modules.

Each module will have the following parts:

- Introduction
- Key concepts
- Demo walk-through
- Exercise
- Downloadable notes

Some modules will build on each other, so watch out for prerequisite warnings:

{{% warning title="Prerequisite" %}}
  Don't read JavaScript? This is not the course you're looking for.
{{% /warning %}}


You'll also see some notes!

{{% note title="Hello World" %}}
  I'll sprinkle little notes throughout the course for your enjoyment!
{{% /note %}}

## What to expect

* Opinionated code
* Templating with Preact (JSX) 
* You'll need a Firebase account using the free tier

I've written unopinionated courses. It's not fun. So I've made some decisions.

If you're not familiar with Preact or JSX, don't worry. They're both easy to read, and I've de-emphasized them as much as possible.

Firebase's free tier is **very generous**. There are some uses of Firebase Functions that require upgrading to a paid plan, but they're not required.

## This course is not...

* Framework agnostic
* Exhaustive documentation
* Constantly updated

Firebase is framework-agnostic... but good luck writing a modern web application without at least JSX.

I'll reference the [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) quite a bit throughout. I will not be trying to duplicate them.

Firebase is constantly changing. The docs are canonical. Use them. I'll do my best to update this content, but I can't promise much. Have you found an error or a bug? Don't hesistate to file an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/how-to-firebase/tutorials) or make pull requests.
